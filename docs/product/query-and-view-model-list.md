# Query and view-model inventory

This is the requirement-backed read-layer plan for the committed product scope. It names query operations and their feature-owned response views. A query is a read, list, preview, or derived assessment; a POST transport does not make a read a command. The response views below are proposed contracts to backfill, not evidence that a handler, projection, API route, or authorization policy already exists.

## Existing inventory

Before this backfill, the source inventory recorded **216 query contracts** and **436 models/supporting contracts**. The current code now contains **270 query contracts** (216 existing plus 54 added here) and **489 model/supporting contracts** (436 existing plus 53 response views added here). The full, source-linked query list and feature-owned models are in the [component inventory](component-inventory.md#existing-queries) and [model appendix](component-inventory.md#existing-models-and-supporting-contracts). Those totals are a static source inventory, not proof that every query is authorized, registered, tested, or satisfies its owning story. Reconcile by behavior before adding a new name: a current query can satisfy a requirement even when its vocabulary differs.

## Required read workflows to backfill

The 54 planned query contracts and 53 response-view types listed below now have one source file each under their owning feature. This fills the contract-file gap recorded in the source audit. Wiring and behavior status varies by query; a contract alone does not prove handler, read-model, API/MCP, or story-level authorization coverage. Existing contracts with incomplete consumers are tracked as completion gaps rather than duplicated here.

## Explicitly excluded from this backfill

- T2-08 integration endpoints, collection runs, and reconciliation queries remain optional collection hypotheses; manual source completeness and reconciliation remain the requirement baseline.
- F1-03 staff capacity and assignment-conflict queries are excluded until that staffing-capacity feature is accepted.
- BO-01/02/03 organization handover, hosted billing, and add-on queries remain excluded while their policy decisions are unsettled.
- Direct external auditor account and identity administration queries are excluded; T1/T3 request and access workflows above do not imply a separate auditor account product.
- Privacy lifecycle query families are not enumerated because the required Privacy scope remains unresolved.

## Read-model rules

Every listed query must enforce tenant, program, permission, sensitive-field, and independence boundaries before returning rows, totals, cursor state, exports, or derived results. Cross-client portfolio and personal-work reads require explicit authority and independent per-client filtering. Preview responses are derived and non-authoritative; they must identify relevant source versions and be recomputed at the owning command boundary. Historical and reproducible results must retain or reference exact input versions. Do not create one generic view that crosses feature ownership or leaks fields unnecessary to its consumer.
