# System instance aggregate cutover

Scope: backend storage and API compatibility contract for the R1-10
application and system-instance inventory. It describes the record boundary
used by manual declaration and later source enhancements. Current delivery,
rollout, and acceptance evidence belong to R1-10's linked backend stories in
[backlog.md](backlog.md); this document is not a deployment readback.

An Application owns metadata revisions. Each SystemInstance now owns a tenant-scoped
`system-instances/{systemInstanceId}` stream, an immutable `ApplicationId`, and its own
revision. Declaring a second instance or revising application metadata does not use
the other stream's optimistic concurrency token. A new declaration changes the
application's derived `has_system_instances` view but creates no application revision.

## V1 HTTP and MCP contract

Declaration is `PUT .../applications/{application_id}/system-instances/{system_instance_id}`: the
client-chosen `system_instance_id` is the logical identity of the creation, an exact retry replays the
original registration after any later change, and a changed declaration conflicts. Revision and
retirement are identified by `command_id` (`PUT .../system-instances/{system_instance_id}/retirements/{command_id}`);
each is one native operation on the instance's own stream and replays exactly under the same actor and
authored intent. A revision that would leave the recorded content unchanged records nothing.

The existing `expected_application_revision` field remains required on declaration.
It now means the parent application source must have reached **at least** that
revision. A metadata revision beyond the supplied value does not reject the
instance declaration. This intentionally changes the earlier equality rule; callers
that require a current metadata snapshot must read the application separately.

`minimum_application_revision` on instance reads still checks only application
metadata source and projection freshness. Exact instance reads additionally accept
optional `minimum_instance_revision`; the instance view exposes `revision`.
Lists check the versioned inventory projector's tenant cursor for pending application
or instance events before returning an empty or partial page. The application's
`has_system_instances` field is eventually projected; use the instance list for a
complete relationship read.

Pending-event checks read at most 256 tenant events after the V2 checkpoint. A larger
backlog returns a retryable conflict instead of scanning further. A historical
instance read trusts its projected row, which carries `legacy_application_revision`;
the parent application stream is read only when the backlog exceeds that limit and
the row is not yet projected.

Boundary and control applicability references to a committed instance that has not
projected yet return a retryable conflict. An unknown or foreign instance ID remains a
permanent conflict.

## Replay and deployment

The `ApplicationDirectoryV2` projection rebuilds in a new Fitz namespace from the
ordered tenant event cursor. It consumes old `SystemInstanceDeclared` application
events and new `SystemInstanceRegistered` instance events. Old application history
keeps its original instance rows and revision numbers. The new instance view retains
the old actor, timestamp, source, and `legacy_application_revision`; new views leave
that provenance field null. Projector data and checkpoint commit atomically, so
restart replays only uncommitted events.

Drain old API writers before switching traffic to the new write path. Old binaries
cannot honor the new stream boundary. During V2 backfill, new declarations return a
retryable conflict if historical instance events remain behind its checkpoint; the
tenant-scoped identity lookup then prevents a legacy ID from being reused under a
different application. Read clients retry transient conflicts until the V2 worker
has caught up.

If an old writer was not drained and the same instance ID reaches both an
application stream and an instance stream, the projector keeps the first row it
sees and keeps advancing. Identical content is ignored. Different content adds
`declaration_conflict` to the kept row's `unresolved` facts so the collision is
visible on instance reads. The later event's application revision history is still
recorded.

Do not delete the old application event streams or the old projection
namespace during this cutover.
