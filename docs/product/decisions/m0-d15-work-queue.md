# M0-D15: Daily work queue, reminders, and escalation

Status: accepted, 2026-09-22. Decision owner: Jeff Repanich (product owner).
Closes [M0-D15 #72](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/72).

## Source workflows on day one

`AccountableWorkItem` is a projection (ADR 0007, M0-A05), not a second source of
workflow truth. Its first sources are:

| Source | Work item |
| --- | --- |
| Controls (R2-01, R2-04) | A control occurrence that is due or overdue |
| Evidence requests (R2-03) | An open request for evidence |
| Reviews and approvals | A pending EN-04 decision assigned to the person or their team |
| Findings (R2-07) | Corrective actions |
| Access review campaigns (R2-06) | Pending reviewer decisions and remediations |
| Policy campaigns (R2-10) | Pending acknowledgements |

Every item links to its exact source record. Completing work happens in the
source workflow, and the item then disappears from the queue.

## Finding closure decision work

The backend includes `finding_closure_review` when a finding has at least one
corrective action, every action is completed, and the finding remains open for
independent verification. The item links to the existing HTTP-only finding
closure operation. The finding remains the authority for required evidence,
verification rationale, program-management permission, and separation of duties.

Ordinary closure work is visible to active non-firm-staff tenant members with
`program.manage` (including explicitly authorized persisted guest memberships)
who are neither the current finding owner nor an action owner or completer.
A member requiring an approved separation-of-duties waiver uses the finding's
existing direct workflow; queue reads do not infer or grant that exception.

The work identity includes the exact finding revision. Revising or reopening a
finding creates a new work identity; an earlier assignment cannot authorize or
assign the new round. New incomplete corrective work removes the closure item,
and closure removes it. Counts, item reads, reminders, and digest content all
use the same source-derived item and eligibility rules.

A separate tenant-scoped Fitz projection stores the finding's decision-work
inputs and remediation checkpoint in one transaction. Queue reads return a
transient conflict while it lags or changes during enumeration. This is the
existing per-source freshness guarantee; it does not establish cross-stream
atomicity or resolve access-campaign program placement.

## Ordering

Items are ordered by:

1. due date ascending, which puts overdue items first;
2. then by materiality from the source record, `high`, then `medium`, then
   `low`, with items whose source has no materiality sorting after `low`;
3. then by item creation time;
4. then by work-item identifier as the final tie-break.

Items without a due date sort after every dated item. The order is
deterministic for a given projection as-of time.

## Assignment actions

| Action | Who may perform it |
| --- | --- |
| `claim` an unassigned team item | Any member of that team with the source workflow's required role |
| `assign`, `reassign` | Compliance Lead or Org Admin |
| `delegate` | The current assignee, to someone eligible under the source workflow |
| `escalate` | Any assignee, and the system (see below) |

Every action is attributed and checked against the separation-of-duties rules
the product owner set under M0-D03 on the same day. An item cannot be assigned to a person the source workflow would
reject.

## Reminders, digest, and escalation

- **Reminders:** in-app, at the due date and when an item becomes overdue.
- **Digest:** one weekly email per member, listing their overdue items and
  items due in the next 7 days. It is the only email for R2. Per-item email is
  not sent. Members may opt out of the digest but not out of in-app reminders.
  The schedule, cross-Program aggregation, and delivery-outcome policy are
  specified by the [R2 weekly work digest decision](r2-weekly-work-digest-delivery.md).
- **Escalation:** an item 7 days overdue escalates automatically to the
  Compliance Lead, recorded as a system-actor escalation. Escalation adds
  visibility; it does not reassign the item.

The in-app queue, due-date calculations, and default escalation are native
workflow behavior available during manual operation. The user can still act
on the source work when email delivery or an optional external automation is
unavailable; neither changes the source workflow's authority or completion.

## Consequences

[R2-11 #54](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/54),
[R2-11a #119](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/119), and
[#284](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/284) adopt these sources,
ordering, actions, and notification rules. R2-11b and R2-11c follow the same
rules.
