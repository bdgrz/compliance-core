# M0-D14: Readiness-consultant collaboration

Status: accepted, 2026-09-22. Decision owner: Jeff Repanich (product owner).
Closes [M0-D14 #71](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/71).

## Channel

- **Our firm's consultants** work **in the product** as `Advisor`-role
  assignees of an accepted `ServiceEngagement` for that client (M0-D25).
  Removing the assignment revokes access immediately.
- **External consultants hired directly by a client** get a scoped, revocable
  **guest membership**:
  - it is limited to the programs the Org Admin grants;
  - it has no approval rights;
  - it expires on a required end date.

Implementation invariant: an accepted guest receives only direct, program-scoped,
time-limited Viewer grants. The existing Viewer role supplies `tenant.access`;
guest authorization exposes that permission only on open advisor handoffs, and
ordinary program reads remain denied.

The accepted end date is persisted on the guest `Member` registration. Event-sourced
membership eligibility stops access at the end of that UTC date, and later grant
proposals cannot extend beyond it. Work queues, access reviews, and work digests
remain outside the guest handoff boundary.

  No export handoff package, secure link, or third-party platform is built
  for R2.

## Draft sharing

An `AdvisorHandoff` is a bounded selection of exact draft record versions that
the Compliance Lead marks `ready_for_review`. Advisors and guests see only
records in an open handoff, plus records that are already approved. Drafts that
were never marked ready stay invisible to them. Closing or revoking a handoff
removes the access; history stays.

## "Consultant validated"

`AdvisorFeedback` has the kinds `comment`, `change_request`, and `validated`.

- `validated` is a distinct attributed review of an exact record version. It
  **is not** an approval: it never changes the record's approval state, and
  it never satisfies a separation-of-duties or approval requirement.
- An internal approval remains an EN-04 decision by an authorized member.
- Validation is invalidated when a new version supersedes the validated one.

## Feedback

Feedback records its author (the Advisor or guest member), time, target record
version, and kind. It is immutable after posting; a correction is a new entry
that links back. Revocation removes future access, never past attribution.

## Consequences

[R2-08 #22](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/22) and
[#275](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/275) adopt in-product
review, `ready_for_review` handoffs, and the validation semantics. The scoped
guest membership follows the role catalog and grant scopes in ADR 0002
(M0-A04).
