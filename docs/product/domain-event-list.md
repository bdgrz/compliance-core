# Domain event universe and backfill list

Baseline: repository source and the accepted backlog reviewed 2026-10-17. This is the event counterpart to the [system command list](command-list.md) and [query/view-model list](query-and-view-model-list.md).

## Existing event contracts

The source inventory contains **237 `DomainEvent` contracts**. Their complete feature-grouped, source-linked list is in the [component inventory](component-inventory.md#existing-events). Those are coded event types; this does not by itself prove the owning command handlers emit them, persistence retains them, or projectors consume them.

## Backfill result

- **136 missing event contracts** support accepted, requirement-backed workflows below.
- **8 additional event contracts** belong to readiness-material import and stay deferred with that feature until its prerequisites and durable import boundary are implemented.
- The named universe is therefore **373 current-plus-required event contracts**, with **8 deferred import events** outside the immediate backfill.

These names were reconciled against current `DomainEvent` declarations, the pruned command inventory, and gap-analysis sections G01–G20. Event names retain business facts and outcomes; they are not a one-for-one mirror of every command or query. Existing events remain the owner when they already represent a required fact. Each backfill event is a typed contract for the listed story outcome. Payloads carry tenant and subject identity, revision, optional member attribution, and occurrence time; handlers still need to populate and emit them, and projectors still need to consume them.

## Required backfill by feature

### Evidence capture and support — EN-06, R2-03/04/05

**Requirement source:** [EN-06](backlog.md#en-06-store-governed-artifacts-with-immutable-content-identity), [R2-03](backlog.md#r2-03-request-and-capture-trustworthy-evidence), [R2-04](backlog.md#r2-04-perform-a-control-and-attest-to-the-result), [R2-05](backlog.md#r2-05-review-control-design-implementation-and-evidence).

The generic evidence-to-record relationship and the durable issuance of authorized artifact access. Capture, inspection, and quarantine-release facts already have events.

Events to backfill:
- `EvidenceSupportLinked`
- `EvidenceArtifactDownloadIssued`

### Evidence handling, disclosure, holds, and disposition — R2-12

**Requirement source:** [R2-12](backlog.md#r2-12-govern-evidence-access-retention-and-disclosure); [M0-D16](decisions/m0-d16-evidence-handling.md).

Policy assignment, engagement/report hold lifecycle, exact-recipient disclosure, and authorized disposition intent/result. Existing artifact legal-hold and retention-basis events are reused.

Events to backfill:

### Application and commitment lifecycle — R1-10/13

Explicit instance revision and historically safe commitment retirement; existing application/system-instance declare/revise/retire and commitment approval events continue to own their current facts.

Events to backfill:
- `SystemInstanceRevised`
- `CommitmentRetired`

## Deferred event family — readiness-material import

R1-09/EN-05 is a committed feature, but the command plan marks the multi-family import slice deferred until prerequisites are met. Do not implement a second import event stream until the handler design resolves how the existing application-import staging, sealing, effect-pending, commit, cancel, and failure facts are reused or generalized. If readiness-material imports retain a distinct family, these are the candidate lifecycle facts:

- `ReadinessMaterialImportStaged`
- `ReadinessMaterialImportRowResolved`
- `ReadinessMaterialImportAccepted`
- `ReadinessMaterialImportCanceled`
- `ReadinessMaterialImportExecutionStarted`
- `ReadinessMaterialImportEffectPending`
- `ReadinessMaterialImportCommitted`
- `ReadinessMaterialImportFailed`

## Reuse, exclusions, and event rules

- Reuse existing evidence facts for artifact registration, inspection, quarantine release, legal holds, retention basis, and redaction. Reuse existing application-import lifecycle facts for application inventory imports.
- Reuse existing service-engagement acceptance/revocation, independence reevaluation, and assignment-revocation facts. The backfill adds only the missing partner ratification/evaluation and actual assignment facts.
- Periodic policy, risk, provider, and management review occurrences reuse M0-D19 control-occurrence and review/finding workflows; do not create parallel policy/risk/vendor-review event families.
- Exclude T1-03 direct external-auditor access events, T2-08 integration/agent events, F1-03 capacity-planning events, BO-01/02/03 handover/billing/add-on events, and Privacy lifecycle events while those remain optional, unvalidated, or policy-gated. T1-04 request/response records and T1-05 packages remain in scope.
- Weekly digest scheduling/delivery outcomes remain decision-gated under G08. The command names in the provisional command inventory do not establish the delivery-consent and retry policy needed for durable event contracts.
- A projector rebuilds from retained facts; it does not decide policy. Events require tenant identity, stable resource/revision identity, actor/time where attributable, and exact source-version references where history or reproducibility depends on them. External effects must distinguish committed intent from observed provider completion.
