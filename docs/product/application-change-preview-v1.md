# Application change preview v1

Status: bounded backend contract for R1-10d
[#217](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/217), with related retirement
and access-review scope operations below. The preview itself is an advisory
read of tenant-authored Application content. It does not persist a proposal,
approve a revision, retire an Application, or assert complete impact. Current
delivery and acceptance evidence belong to the linked issues.

`POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/applications/{application_id}/change-previews`
uses Portia's API-user authentication and an active tenant membership. It
requires application-inventory read authority and organization-wide program
read access (`tenant.access`) because the response can disclose relationships
across programs. Inventory authority comes from `application_inventory.manage`
or an applicable restricted-read grant. When the Application is restricted,
the record guard additionally requires `application.restricted.read` at an
organization or Application scope, as
defined by the [restricted application visibility decision](decisions/restricted-application-visibility.md).
The machine-appropriate `bdgrz.application.change.preview` MCP tool is
registered `ReadOnly`; all arguments are flat scalars.

The JSON body has `expected_application_revision` (positive), `change_kind`
(`revise` or `retire`), and, for `revise`, `name`, `purpose`, and optional
`owner_reference`, `classification`, `system_owner_person_id`,
`access_owner_person_id`, `application_kind`, and `criticality`. The four added
fields are optional, default to null, and preserve discriminator version 1 and
the existing `expected_application_revision` wire name. Owner IDs are nullable
UUIDs referencing recorded workforce Persons in this tenant; they grant no
membership or authority. The same Person can fill both roles. Free-text
`owner_reference` is separate attribution and cannot substitute for either ID.
A `retire` preview rejects every supplied revised field, including empty UUIDs
and blank new strings. The operation emits no event and changes no Application
or boundary record.

For `revise`, the handler uses the same resulting-content rule as
`ReviseApplication`, against the authoritative Application at the expected
revision. `Compliance:Applications:GovernedRevisionsEnabled` remains false in
committed configuration. With this independent gate off, omitted/null owner
IDs and classification clear their existing values; blank classification also
clears. With the gate on, omitted/null owner IDs and classification retain their
recorded values, explicit blank classification rejects, and all required
resulting metadata must be present. Both modes retain omitted/null application
kind and criticality. Supplied kind and criticality trim first, must be nonblank,
and allow at most 200 characters after trimming. Name (200), purpose (2000),
owner reference (2000), and classification (200) preserve the revision rule's
raw-input bounds before trimming. Owner reference trims and clears on blank or
null in either mode. Empty owner UUIDs reject; both supplied and gate-on retained
effective owner IDs are revalidated against same-tenant Person source records.

`changes` contains only actual differences between the exact-revision projection
and normalized resulting content across `name`, `purpose`, `owner_reference`,
`classification`, `system_owner_person_id`, `access_owner_person_id`,
`application_kind`, and `criticality`. Owner before/after values are canonical
UUID strings or null, never Person names. Retained or equal normalized values
produce no change. Restriction editing and comparison are excluded. Applying
these changes to that baseline yields the content a successful save of identical
submitted values, gate mode and expected Application revision records in its
single `ApplicationRevised` event. The save still performs its own authorization,
owner validation and expected-revision checks; preview gives no approval token
or frozen observation.

The 200 result contains `tenant_id`, `application_id`,
`application_revision`, `change_kind`, a list of changed content fields with
`before` and `after`, up to 200 current draft and approved or historical
`boundary_references`, up to 200 current direct-Application
`control_draft_references`, up to 200 approved `approved_control_references`,
up to 200 direct-Application `policy_references`, up to 200
`evidence_source_references`, up to 200 currently visible outgoing
`application_relationships`, up to 200 `access_population_references`,
`pending_contexts`, and `complete`. A control
reference contains the stable control, program, applicability-entry, and
current draft revision identifiers plus the authored subject and rationale; it
does not contain full draft content. `complete` is always `false` in this
slice. `policy_references` contains policy and program IDs, identifier, title,
revision or approved version, direct applicability subject, effective interval,
and successor or retirement state. It never contains policy body text.
`evidence_source_references` contains support-link, Control, and artifact IDs,
the exact supported record type and revision, the artifact revision, covered
period, and purpose. It omits artifact content hashes, sufficiency rationales,
and actor details. Each row is returned only when the caller has the exact
`evidence_artifact.read` grant for that artifact. Hidden artifacts are omitted
without disclosing their IDs or metadata, and keep `evidence_sources` pending.
`access_population_references` contains only the population ID, reviewed-system
ID and revision, observation time, population revision and status, plus the
accepted snapshot ID and time when present. Population facts, source text, and
attestation are not included. `access_population_references_over_limit` is
added when the bounded result truncates.
`boundary_references_over_limit` and
`control_draft_references_over_limit` are added when their respective result
sets exceed 200, rather than silently presenting a truncated set as complete.
`application_relationships_over_limit` is added when more than 200 visible
active outgoing relationships exist, rather than silently presenting a truncated
relationship list as complete.
`application_relationships` contains active outgoing `depends_on` and `replaces`
records only when the caller can read each target under the existing restricted
Application visibility rules. Removed relationships and hidden targets are
omitted. The `application_relationships` pending context remains because this
source-only read cannot discover incoming links to the Application. When the
preview exceeds 200 visible outgoing relationships, clients can use the
application relationship list endpoint to page through the complete visible
outgoing list. The preview does not establish complete relationship impact or
authorize successor approval.

`control_draft_references` include only non-discarded, currently indexed
`application` applicability entries. They do not establish an approved or
effective ControlVersion, activation, retirement, historical relationship,
coverage, effectiveness, or a complete lifecycle impact. Approved control
versions and lifecycle are contributed by their own tenant-scoped projection.
Policy references include direct `application` and concrete `system_instance`
applicability from the current draft and retained approved versions. The policy
projection stores only relationship metadata, not policy bodies. An indirect
Control, Criterion, Risk, Vendor, Process, or Scope reference, an applicability
entry without a governed record ID, or a truncated result keeps `policies`
pending because this slice cannot resolve those relationships authoritatively.
The policy and Control projections are read under separate tenant source
checkpoints; they do not establish a global cross-system snapshot. Other pending
contexts include `application_relationships`, vendors, evidence sources, access
review campaigns, open work, readiness, and engagements. Historical discarded
drafts are not in the current-draft reverse indexes; their source event streams
retain them.

Evidence support is joined only when the supported record type is `control` or
`control_version`; both identify the stable Control aggregate ID. Support for
`control_occurrence`, `control_evaluation`, or `period` cannot yet be mapped to
an affected Application control and keeps `evidence_sources` pending. The
preview reads at most 200 support links, and reports
`evidence_source_references_over_limit` when it truncates. Incomplete or
truncated affected-Control references, a missing evidence projection or exact
artifact access check, and import-worker reads without a personal user identity
also keep this context pending. Evidence links use their own tenant checkpoint;
their freshness fence does not create a global cross-system snapshot.

The preview reads the bounded population history for each projected
`SystemInstance`, returning draft and accepted population summaries without
their facts. It checks the separate tenant population projection before and
after reading. Truncated population histories or an incomplete SystemInstance
list keep `access_populations` pending; a projection that has not caught up
returns a retryable 409.

The handler hydrates the tenant Application aggregate, checks its exact
revision against the Fitz Application projection, and checks the boundary,
Control, approved-Control-version, policy, evidence-support, and access-population
projection checkpoints against their corresponding tenant source streams before
and after reading references. It rechecks the Application and relationship source revisions after
the projection reads. A source write
detected during the read returns a retryable 409. A missing or wrong-tenant Application returns 404
without disclosing another tenant. Invalid request fields return 400. A stale
expected revision returns 409. This advisory observation is not an atomic
cross-stream snapshot, freeze, or digest that could be used for approval; a
later write can still race a completed preview.

The existing `ReviseApplication` command still applies a manual change
directly. A governed successor, retirement, and in-use deletion gate require
the M0-D05 inventory rules, scoped access, and complete contributions from the
owning downstream contexts. Those later operations must not infer clearance
from this preview. Backend child #217 and product parent
[#105](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/105) own the remaining
lifecycle and impact acceptance.

## Retirement and access-review scope (bundle for #215 and #217)

The preview also returns up to 200 projected `system_instance_references`, and adds
`system_instance_references_over_limit` when there are more. It rejects a retired Application
with a 409.

`POST .../applications/{application_id}/retirements` (`bdgrz.application.retire`) records an
effective-dated `ApplicationRetired` with a reason and an optional active `merged_into_application_id`.
`POST .../system-instances/{system_instance_id}/retirements` (`bdgrz.system_instance.retire`)
retires one registered instance. Retirement keeps all revisions, instances, and scope history.
A retired record rejects later revisions, new instances, and new scope decisions. Directory and
revision views carry `lifecycle` and `retirement`.

`POST .../system-instances/{system_instance_id}/access-review-scope-decisions` is an HTTP-only
Compliance Lead approval. It requires `application_inventory.manage` plus organization-wide
`program.manage`. It appends an `included` or `excluded` decision with a reason,
`effective_from`, and an optional `review_by`, bound to the exact instance revision and the
expected decision count. A new decision supersedes the previous one. It cannot be backdated
before the previous decision. The member who registered the instance and the application's
access owner resolved for this request cannot approve its scope without an active exact-scope
`system_instance_access_review_scope` waiver. The handler reads the governed Application and
its owner Person from their tenant's event streams, using the person's current member
correlation. Reassigning ownership, relinking membership, or clearing the link affects later
decisions without editing earlier decisions. A Person reference or correlation grants no
approval authority; the existing `program.manage` authorization still applies.
`GET .../access-review-scope` (`bdgrz.system_instance.access_review_scope.get`) returns the
decision in effect at an optional `as_of` time (`unresolved` when none applies) and the full
history, read from the source stream.

Scope decisions and reads also accept legacy instances declared in the application stream
(revision 1). The write path reads that declaration from its source stream, and the
registrant and current access-owner rules apply to that instance too.

`GET .../applications/{application_id}/access-review-scopes`
(`bdgrz.application.access_review_scopes.list`, read-only) pages the application's instances
and, for each, returns `status` (`included`, `excluded`, or `unresolved`) at an optional
`as_of`, `review_overdue`, `decision_count`, the `effective` decision, and the `upcoming` one.
It reads the new `AccessReviewScopeDirectoryV1` Fitz projection. The endpoint returns a
retryable 409 until both that projection and the instance directory reach their sources.

The owner predicate uses authoritative Application and Person observations under the existing
per-request authorization boundary. As specified in
[ADR 0003](../architecture/decisions/0003-event-sourced-history-and-effective-versions.md),
the destination stream's optimistic check does not make unrelated source writes atomic:
an owner or correlation change may interleave between these reads and the decision append.
[#519](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/519) owns the stronger current-at-commit
source preconditions as a separate follow-up, using Fitz conditional writes and Portia support.
It is separate from #463's canonical owner predicate acceptance. `AccessReviewScopeOwnerE2ETests`
proves the owner rule, legacy-instance decisions, the projection and its transient lag through
the real broker, standalone and split-host, with tenant isolation.

The directed relationship record/list/remove slice is documented in
[application-relationships-v1.md](application-relationships-v1.md) (#977).
A governed successor or approval gate and complete downstream impact remain
open under [#464](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/464).

## Information asset change preview ([#465](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/465))

`POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/information-assets/{information_asset_id}/change-previews`
(`bdgrz.inventory.information_asset.change.preview`, read-only) takes
`expected_revision` and an optional proposed `classification` and `lifecycle`. It returns
every active data flow that carries the asset. For each flow it gives the flow's
classification recomputed as the highest carried classification, `encryption_violation`
under M0-D08, and `carries_retired_asset_only`. The scan stops at 1000 flows and sets
`flows_over_limit` when it stops early. The preview records nothing and does not revise any
flow.
