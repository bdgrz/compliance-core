# Required component inventory

Planning baseline: local product contracts and backend source inspected 2026-10-17.

For the reconciled command list, requirement coverage and remaining work, use [System command list](command-list.md), with rationale in the [command gap analysis](command-inventory-gap-analysis.md). Its command conclusions supersede the provisional completion suggestions below, including periodic-review subsystems and external-auditor account proposals.

For the read layer, use the [query and view-model list](query-and-view-model-list.md) for the pruned, story-backed backfill. Proposed query candidates later in this inventory are not all required; optional collection and unsettled commerce/capacity hypotheses are excluded there.

For the event layer, use the [domain event list](domain-event-list.md) for the pruned, story-backed backfill. It supersedes unvalidated event candidates in the proposed completion inventory below.

This inventory covers commands, queries, domain events, aggregates, models, HTTP/MCP APIs, reactors, and projectors for the documented Compliance product. It includes the complete local source inventory below and a proposed completion inventory for later workflows. Source presence is not proof of delivery, registration, tests, authorization correctness, or release acceptance. GitHub delivery status was not audited for this document.

## How to read the inventory

- **Commands** express an attributable intent and may change authoritative state.
- **Queries** read or preview state. HTTP POST does not necessarily mean a command.
- **Events** retain accepted domain facts; they do not replace operational logs.
- **Aggregates** enforce consistency and workflow transitions. A model is not automatically an aggregate.
- **Models** include entities, immutable versions, relationships, decisions, snapshots, request results, and read views.
- **APIs** expose authorized operations through HTTP and, where appropriate, MCP. Internal commands and human approvals are not automatically MCP tools.
- **Reactors** consume facts and perform follow-up commands or external effects. They require tenant scope, stable deduplication identity, safe replay, and inspectable failures.
- **Projectors** derive rebuildable read models. They do not own business decisions or execute side effects.

The existing inventory preserves actual source names, including older vocabulary. Proposed names below are design candidates, not approved aggregate boundaries or a declaration that similarly named existing behavior is missing. Compare capabilities and invariants before adding anything.

Sources: [product scope](README.md), [domain ownership](domain-model.md), [canonical models](canonical-entity-model.md), [backlog](backlog.md), [commercial scope](business-operations.md), [projection rules](../architecture/decisions/0007-read-models-projections-and-as-of-calculations.md), [work-source coverage](work-queue-source-coverage.md).

## Required capability checklist

Each capability needs its owning commands and queries, retained facts, domain state, authorized API surface, and read models. A reactor is required only where an asynchronous reaction is actually needed. The source appendix names the components already present for these capabilities.

## Cross-cutting requirements and unresolved design

- Reuse the existing version, actor, decision, scope, content-identity and snapshot primitives. Keep review and approval transitions with the workflow; do not introduce a universal Review aggregate.
- Every owning entity needs only the lifecycle operations its contract permits: draft creation/revision, review, approval, successor, retirement and never-used-draft deletion where applicable. Historical use prevents destructive removal.
- Decisions bind exact versions, input identities, actor, time and rationale. Readiness calculations and population completeness remain distinct from auditor conclusions.
- Preserve manual capture for evidence, workforce/access populations, operational facts, professional handoffs and all compliance outcomes. Collection and integrations remain optional.
- The canonical catalog's finer device, resource, network and provider facets are not an instruction to build a full CMDB. Add persistence and APIs when an approved story consumes them.
- Every read must apply tenant, permission, sensitive-field and independence rules before rows, counts, cursors, exports or derived results become visible.
- Use versioned projector identities and atomic rows/checkpoints. Freshness applies per required source/projection; reproducible history requires retained exact inputs or snapshots.
- Schedule time-driven checks through an explicit clock/tick/job contract. Ordinary event consumption alone does not detect elapsed deadlines, expiry or missing occurrences. Reminders, waiver expiry, acceptance expiry, retention eligibility and recurring work each need an owning policy and safe scheduler.
- A reminder reactor must not silently approve work, expire a business decision, release a hold or dispose of content. Those transitions require their owning commands and authorization.
- Reactor follow-up commands and external effects need stable IDs, durable progress, retry/recovery and duplicate suppression. Distinguish committed intent from observed provider completion.
- Commercial command names and events remain provisional until pricing, payer, payment, lifecycle, handover and add-on acceptance policies are settled in business-operations.md.
- Portfolio queries require an explicit cross-client authority contract and independent per-client filtering. Existing tenant-local projections do not authorize shared cross-client storage.
- Offboarding retention duration, exact auditor deliverables, provider adapters and additional Privacy lifecycle coverage remain governed follow-up scope. Do not fill these gaps with invented policy.

## Exact existing backend inventory

The following is a static source inventory, including internal operations. Queries are classified by mapped HTTP GET operations and read/preview name conventions; remaining IRequest contracts are listed as commands. This is a planning classification, not an automated proof of purity. In particular, exports, previews and authentication POST operations require semantic review before exposure to automation. Supporting models include enums and interfaces in Compliance.Common; they are not all persistent business entities.

| Category | Unique feature/type names |
| --- | ---: |
| Commands | 230 |
| Queries | 271 |
| Events | 372 |
| Aggregates | 83 |
| Models and supporting contracts | 561 |
| Reactors | 30 |
| Projectors | 66 |
| Explicit MapPortia HTTP route registrations | 327 |
