## Decision

- A client organization is the only tenant boundary. `tenant_id` is its immutable, opaque UUID in APIs, events, jobs, and storage realms; `Organization` is the product name. Every client business record belongs to exactly one tenant. Platform-level criteria editions, methodology templates, and the firm-staff directory may exist outside tenants but cannot contain client records.
- `PlatformOperators:UserIds` seeds the operator roster only before its first event. Later grants and revocations use the current roster stream; each event records actor ID and Bdgrz-session display snapshot, subject, time, and reason, and the last operator cannot be revoked. A grant requires a registered platform user. No production operator is inferred from authentication claims, email domains, or tenant membership. Developer identities are operators only in the local developer-authentication mode.
- A platform operator is the platform super administrator for platform operations: suspension, reactivation, slug administration, firm-staff invitations, and inspection of organization metadata and memberships. The operator portfolio is a paginated platform-scoped query at `GET /api/v1/platform/tenants` and a read-only MCP tool. It includes provisioning and suspended organizations. Operator status alone confers no client business-record access.
- Production registration records display name, legal name, slug, and the signed-in creator's platform user ID. The server finds a verified email in that user's directory; the request does not supply an administrator email. `TenantRegistered` records creator administration intent and requires an activation event only for registrations created after the fence. The worker materializes client-personnel membership, administrator-team assignment, and effective grants before activation. Historical self-service registrations remain active on replay; operator-provisioned registrations retain the invited first-administrator flow, and local developer registration without an invitation still bootstraps its creator. Verification challenges are delivered by a recoverable worker.
- A firm-staff invitation creates a `firm_staff` membership when accepted. Neither membership nor a current or historical tenant team grant confers standing business access. Accepted service-engagement assignment is the later access path under #269. Advisory or attest practice designation belongs in a future platform-level staff record, not in the tenant membership.
- Suspension preserves events, projections, and memberships while tenant-scoped authorization reads the event-sourced current lifecycle and denies immediately. Reactivation restores access without recreating records. System reactions may finish cleanup and bootstrap while suspended.
- Browser selection is derived from the signed-in user's membership list. There is no server-side mutable “active tenant” claim or token role. Every tenant API path carries `tenant_id`, which the server authorizes. The browser may retain one selected tenant in navigation state; changing selection must clear tenant-specific client state when UI work begins.
- Browser slugs are attributes. The server normalizes and validates them against a single reserved-route registry. New slugs are reserved in an event-sourced slug aggregate before a tenant switches. Old slugs retain their owner, become permanently unavailable for new registrations, and resolve only for an authenticated member of that active tenant. Unknown and inaccessible slugs return the same not-found response.
- Slugs can reveal a client name in browser history and server logs. The API host sends `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on browser routes, static assets, and API responses so navigation does not forward a client path as a referrer. Product naming guidance and log retention still belong to M0-A07.
- API startup checks each newly reserved top-level route against event-sourced slug ownership, including retired slugs, and fails if an organization claimed it before the route was added. Registration cannot claim a reserved route even through a direct system command. Resolve a collision before deploying the new route.
- Each external issuer-plus-subject identity binds to exactly one platform user, who can hold several memberships. The service validates several configured trusted OIDC issuers directly. Linking another identity requires explicit proof of both identities; email equality never links them. Provider expansion and recovery rules remain governed by ADR 0009.

## M0-A07 tenant-context contract

The URL's opaque `tenant_id` selects the tenant for an organization-scoped HTTP
operation. Portia's route binding wins if JSON also includes `tenant_id`; the
handler, authorizer, and stream use the route value. The two-tenant program
broker test supplies a conflicting body value and verifies that only the URL
tenant changes. API clients should omit the redundant body field. MCP tools
carry one explicit tenant ID in their typed input and run the same request
authorizer. The server never accepts an IdP organization or role claim as a
membership grant.

Fitz tenant-owned streams use the immutable tenant UUID as their realm. A
reactor keeps that realm, its triggering event, and a named system actor when
dispatching a follow-up request. Projector reads and checkpoints use a tenant
realm. New cache keys, search indexes, artifact paths, exports, jobs, and
notifications must include the tenant UUID, and their backend children must
prove that cross-tenant resources, counts, and delivery targets stay separate.
Logs and telemetry should carry the opaque tenant UUID and correlation ID,
while excluding invitation tokens, evidence content, and client names from
routine labels. This is a contract for later features, not a claim that every
future surface already exists.

Configured trusted OIDC issuers are validated directly. Before enabling an
additional authority in a deployment, review its issuer configuration and
account-linking recovery. An external identity is keyed by
exact issuer plus subject and belongs to one `PlatformUser`. Two identities
with the same email do not merge automatically. An explicit HTTP-only link
operation now requires both a signed Bdgrz browser session and a validated OIDC
resource token in one request. It binds a new issuer-plus-subject to the session's
platform user ID; a provider identity already owned by another user conflicts.
Repeating the same link is safe, and ordinary OIDC continuation still creates a
separate user rather than inferring consent from an existing cookie. This is a
technical linking path, not approval to enable multiple authorities. M0-A07
still needs a security review of provider configuration, reauthentication
requirements, identity replacement and revocation, and recovery before that
deployment expands.

Client-provided slugs can reveal a name in browser history or server logs.
`Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` prevents browser referrer disclosure, and
operators should use a neutral slug when a client name is confidential. The
firm's client-naming and log-retention policy remains an M0-A07 product
decision; the service cannot infer confidentiality from the slug string.

## Activation failure isolation (#430)

The per-tenant `TenantInvitation` and `TenantSelfServiceActivationV1` reactors
register an unbounded failed-pass limit, so a prolonged transient outage for
one tenant's activation prerequisites (for example a lagging permission
projection) never throws Portia's `WorkloadFailureException` and never stops the
worker host or other tenants' workloads. Each pass retries locally for eight
seconds, logs `LogActivationDeferred` (event 41502), and returns to durable
replay with its checkpoint unchanged; recovery logs `LogActivationRecovered`
(41503). A permanent (non-transient) failure is replayed up to 20 consecutive
times per worker process and then abandoned with `LogActivationAbandoned`
(41504, error): the checkpoint advances and the tenant stays inactive, which is
fail closed. Operations should alert on any 41504 and on 41502 for one tenant
persisting beyond a few minutes. Recovery for an abandoned activation is an
operator administrator invitation (`POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/invitations`
with `administrator: true`). A worker restart resets only the in-process
permanent-failure count; durable checkpoints replay the pending activation.

## Last active administrator (#432)

A tenant keeps at least one active administrator: a registered, unsuspended
member of the built-in Administrators team, whose undeletable Tenant
Administration role keeps `tenant.access` and `tenant.rbac.manage`. Member
suspension and removal from the Administrators team serialize through the
tenant-scoped `rbac-manager-guard` stream and need another active administrator
read from source streams; a refused change returns a non-transient `409`.
Reinstatement and reassignment clear the guard before the source change. The
Administrators team cannot lose that role, and the role cannot lose those two
permissions. Sequential self-suspension stays rejected. Custom roles that grant
`tenant.rbac.manage` are not counted as the protected anchor. A future member
deprovisioning command must withdraw through the same guard. For a tenant that
was already locked before this guard, the recovery path is a platform operator
administrator invitation, which grants a new administrator without giving the
operator access to business records.

## Alternatives and consequences

Verified self-service creation lets a platform user create an organization and become its first Org Admin without operator action. Granting an operator tenant access by default would create an unrequested cross-client access path. Using email or slug as a tenant identity would make renames and identity-provider changes unsafe. Storing roles in identity-provider tokens would delay revocation and blur the tenant boundary.

The API and MCP surfaces use Portia command/query authorization and event-sourced aggregates, reactors, and Fitz projections. Invitation acceptance and email verification are human HTTP flows and are intentionally absent from MCP. Projection reads can lag; security decisions for suspension use the tenant aggregate and permission checks. Email verification challenge and invitation delivery use recoverable worker reactors and a configured STARTTLS SMTP adapter outside development. Both are at least once across the external send and outcome event boundary; a relay may deliver a duplicate after worker restart.

## Follow-up

M0-D25 and M0-A07 are accepted in the product decision and ADR 0009. #269 owns
engagement-specific staff grants. Later features prove tenant isolation for
their own records and surfaces under
[ADR 0002](0002-authorization-and-tenant-isolation.md#evidence).
