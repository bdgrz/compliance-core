# M0-D02: Criteria content source, edition, and permitted use

Status: decided, 2026-09-22. Decision owner: Jeff Repanich, product owner.

| Question | Decision and rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Edition | The first platform edition is the 2017 Trust Services Criteria with the 2022 revised points of focus. |
| Permitted use | The product ships **no licensed AICPA text**. It ships criterion identifiers (for example `CC6.1`), locally assigned point-of-focus identifiers, and short, original product-written summaries. Licensed criteria text may be supplied through a tenant-owned overlay under the supplier's own AICPA license. The platform does not assume redistribution permission. |
| Points of focus | Points of focus are modeled as first-class catalog entries and are mappable, not reference-only. |
| Initial catalog | The platform catalog (IDs plus original summaries) is platform-level content. A licensed text overlay is supplied per tenant or firm template; the supplier and license scope are confirmed in [#351](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/351). |
| Later editions | A new edition is added side by side as a new immutable catalog edition. Existing programs and engagements keep the edition they selected; migration is an explicit, attributed remapping, never a mutation of an existing edition. |
| Multi-client use | Platform identifiers and original summaries may be used across all client organizations and in exports. Licensed overlay text is used only where the supplier's license permits; any restriction becomes a catalog usage flag. |

## Data-shape rules

- `CriteriaCatalogEdition`: platform-level, immutable once published. Fields:
  `edition_id`, `framework` (`tsc`), `edition_label` (`2017_tsc_2022_pof`),
  `published_at`. It is referenced by exact edition ID from a program.
- `Criterion`: `edition_id`, `identifier` (unique within edition), `category`
  (`security | availability | confidentiality | processing_integrity | privacy`),
  `kind` (`criterion | point_of_focus`), `parent_identifier` (a point of focus
  belongs to exactly one criterion), and `summary` (original product text).
- `CriteriaTextOverlay`: tenant- or template-owned. Fields: `edition_id`,
  `identifier`, `text`, `supplier`, `license_reference`, and `usage_flags`.
  Licensed text never lives in platform-level content or in the repository.
- A control mapping references `(edition_id, identifier)`, never text.

## Ownership and publication update — 2026-11-05

CR-09/10 in [Criteria](../contexts/criteria.md) retain one independent criterion
owner per edition and identifier. Bounded admission windows serialize structural
changes and publication; a verified manifest proves the accepted frozen set. It
is not an edition-owned mutable roster and does not replace criterion outcomes.
The existing seed ID, partial-coverage disclosures and license boundary remain.

## Repository check

The platform seed and tenant-overlay contracts are described in
[Criteria](../contexts/criteria.md). The seed contains criterion
identifiers, locally assigned point-of-focus identifiers, edition metadata,
and original summaries. `PlatformCriteriaCatalogTests` guards the authored
summary boundary. Partial point-of-focus coverage and unsupported Privacy
lifecycle behavior remain explicit support gaps; a complete numbered-criterion
catalog does not prove complete framework support. Current delivery evidence
belongs to the linked implementation issues.

## Follow-up discovery

[#351](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/351) confirms the licensed
catalog supplier and the firm's license scope. R1-03 does not wait on it.
