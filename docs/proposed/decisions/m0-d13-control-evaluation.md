# M0-D13: Control evaluation procedures and tester independence

Status: accepted, 2026-09-22. Decision owner: Jeff Repanich (product owner).
Closes [M0-D13 #70](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/70).

## Procedures

A `ControlEvaluationPlan` version is authored in the product for each control
under evaluation. No consultant procedure library is imported (M0-D04); a
procedure is data the evaluator writes, not a product-supplied template. Each
procedure step records:

- `assertion`: one of `design`, `implementation`, or `evidence_sufficiency`;
- `method`: one of `inquiry`, `inspection`, `observation`, or `reperformance`;
- the inspected items, as exact record versions or artifact content references
  (ADR 0006), typed as boundary, commitment, risk, criterion, control, policy,
  provider, evidence, generic record, or artifact;
- the expected condition.

The plan version is frozen when evaluation starts. A changed plan is a new
version and never rewrites results already recorded.

Each plan version names the exact approved control version it evaluates. Each
procedure step keeps its exact inspected record version or artifact content
reference, so starting an evaluation does not resolve those references to newer
versions later.

## Result vocabulary

- **Per step:** `met`, `not_met`, or `not_tested`, with a rationale.
- **Per assertion, and overall for the `ControlEvaluation`:**
  - `effective`;
  - `effective_with_exceptions`;
  - `ineffective`;
  - `not_tested`.

An overall `effective` requires every step for every assertion to be `met`.

## Deviations

A `not_met` step creates a `ControlEvaluationDeviation` (M0-D23). The
evaluator classifies it as `minor` or `material`:

- **`material`:** creates or links a `Finding` with a corrective action
  (R2-07) and requires a retest. The retest is a new evaluation of the same
  plan version or a successor.
- **`minor`:** needs a recorded disposition, `corrected` or `accepted_with_waiver`
  (a `Waiver` per M0-D23). The overall result is at best
  `effective_with_exceptions`.

A deviation never closes because a later evaluation passed. The retest links
to it explicitly.

## Who may evaluate and review

- **Evaluator:** the control owner **may** evaluate their own control's design
  and implementation. This is a small-team default.
- **Reviewer:** every evaluation requires an independent review, recorded as
  an EN-04 review decision. The reviewer must be a client member holding the
  Compliance Lead or Org Admin role, and must not be the evaluator. Self-review
  is blocked by the separation-of-duties default the product owner set under
  M0-D03 on the same day. The only relief is a recorded, time-bound SoD
  exception approved by a different Org Admin who does not benefit from it,
  following the M0-D03 two-person rule. It is flagged in readiness and audit
  exports.
- **Advisors:** an assigned Advisor may add `validated` feedback on the
  evaluation (M0-D14). That feedback is additive and never counts as the
  independent review.
- **Competence:** a firm procedure, not a product check.

## Consequences

[R2-05 #19](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/19),
[R2-05a #110](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/110), and
[#279](https://github.com/bdgrz/compliance/issues/279) adopt this vocabulary and
evaluator/reviewer rule. The reviewer rule is enforced through the authorization
model accepted in ADR 0002 (M0-A04).
