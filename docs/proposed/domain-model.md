# Compliance domain model

Status: accepted product and domain contract, updated 2026-10-04

This document defines the shared language and relationships used by the
Compliance product backlog. It is a product model, not a database schema or a
commitment to separate services. The bounded contexts below should begin as
cohesive modules inside the existing application.

Canonical identity, workforce, access, application, device, infrastructure,
and provenance terms are defined by the approved
[canonical entity model](../product/canonical-entity-model.md) (M0-D28, 2026-09-22). Where
this document and that catalog differ, the catalog's names and relationship
rules govern. Only
public sources approved by
[source-reference-policy.md](../product/source-reference-policy.md) may shape that model;
information without acceptable use rights is excluded.

## Modeling rules

- Model the compliance process, not a collection of independent CRUD screens.
- Keep definitions, performances, evidence, reviews, decisions, and snapshots
  distinct even when the UI presents them together.
- Give every business record a stable platform identity. Names, email
  addresses, filenames, and provider display values are attributes, not keys.
- Preserve effective history. A correction creates a revision, amendment, or
  superseding record instead of changing completed audit history in place.
- Treat every status as a projection from inspectable business records and
  rules. A status is never an unexplained manual flag.
- Keep authorization and work responsibility distinct. Permission to perform
  an action does not by itself assign the action to someone.
- Preserve source provenance for imported, collected, advisor-authored, and
  auditor-authored material.
- Use explicit domain workflows. A generic task list, activity stream, or audit
  log may summarize work, but it does not own the underlying business state.
- Keep every user-facing workflow usable through authorized user actions when
  external integrations and optional source-collection automation are absent or
  disabled. These tools may reduce setup and recurring effort, but they do not
  replace the governed domain workflow.
- Scope every business record to exactly one client organization (tenant).
  Only explicitly platform-level content, such as criteria catalog editions and
  firm templates, exists outside a tenant, and it never contains client data.

## Cohesive process spine

The primary product flow is:

```text
Client organization (tenant) and membership
  -> Program and system boundary
  -> Workforce, technology, information, and provider inventories
  -> Service commitments, system requirements, and risk assessment
  -> Criteria edition and engagement scope
  -> Control definition and criteria mapping
  -> Responsibility and operating cadence
  -> Control occurrence or other assurance activity
  -> Evidence submission and support relationship
  -> Independent review and decision
  -> Gap, exception, remediation, or accepted result
  -> Explainable readiness view
  -> Frozen engagement or period snapshot
  -> Indexed handoff or audit package
  -> Next engagement or period
```

Every product story must identify where it enters this spine, which upstream
records it relies on, and which downstream records or decisions it affects.

## Bounded contexts

These are conceptual ownership boundaries, not projects, deployments, or
microservices.

| Context | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform access | Client organizations (tenants), platform users, memberships and affiliation, teams, federated identities, access roles, role assignments, operator grants, the firm-staff directory | External accounts and entitlements being audited; engagement assignments, which Firm services owns and authorization consumes |
| Organization commercial operations | Hosted organization subscription, billing administration, selected add-ons, charge and entitlement history | Compliance readiness, professional service acceptance, or a separate firm tenant; exact payment and lifecycle policies await the business-operations readiness decisions |
| Firm services | Service engagements, engagement acceptance, engagement (staff) assignment, nonattest service records, independence rule sets and evaluations, advisory and attest compartments | Client management records or the firm's system of quality management |
| Firm methodology | Platform-level templates, template versions, and template application provenance | Client-owned controls, policies, risks, or evidence created from templates |
| Program and scope | Programs, stages, system boundaries, inclusions, exclusions, engagement plans | Criteria source content or control operation |
| Workforce assurance | People, employment or engagement lifecycle facts, managers, workforce populations, NHI ownership | Platform access or provider accounts |
| Application inventory | Applications, concrete system instances, ownership, classification, lifecycle, review scope | Observed accounts, permissions, and campaign decisions |
| Technology and information inventory | Material system components, information sets, data stores and flows, locations, operational processes, classifications, ownership, lifecycle, source reconciliation | Operational configuration management or data processing |
| Commitments and requirements | Service commitments, system requirements, CUECs, CSOCs, applicability and effective history | Source contract management or proof that controls operated |
| Criteria | Catalog editions, criteria, categories, selected scope, mapping provenance | Organization-authored controls |
| Control environment | Controls, control versions, mappings, responsibilities, cadence, occurrences | Evidence content or external directory populations |
| Policies | Policies, policy versions, reviews, approvals, effective periods | Proof that a control operated |
| Evidence | Evidence artifacts, content identity, provenance, requests, support relationships, review state | The control or decision that evidence supports |
| Risk and provider oversight | Risk assessments, treatments and acceptance decisions, vendors, subservice organizations, provider assurance reviews and boundary treatment | Procurement transactions or auditor opinions over providers |
| Assurance work | Findings, governed waivers, corrective actions and verification, links to source gaps/deviations/exceptions, and work projections | Other workflows' review/approval decisions or risk-acceptance authority; authentication or provider directory state |
| External access governance | Source accounts and groups, entitlements, access assignments, population snapshots, campaigns | Platform membership, platform authorization, or system-instance ownership |
| Change and incident oversight | Compliance-facing `SignificantChange` and `ComplianceIncident` records, chronology, impact/significance assessment, and resulting review work | Operational incident response or change management; R1-07's externally sourced `IncidentReference` and earlier risk-assessment history |
| Engagements and handoffs | Type I baselines, Type II periods, populations, samples, requests, packages, amendments, outcomes | Mutable source records after they have been snapshotted |

Cross-context references use stable identities and explicit versions or
snapshots when history matters. One context must not silently mutate another
context's aggregate.

### Ownership decisions

The 2026-09-14 backlog design review found concepts that this model and the
backlog assign to more than one owner, or to none. [M0-D22's ownership
decision](../product/decisions/m0-d22-canonical-ownership.md) assigns application and
system-instance records to R1-10, people and service identities to R1-11,
client services to R1-02, locations and operational processes to R1-12,
early incident references and control-to-risk treatment to R1-07.
[M0-D23's assurance vocabulary](../product/decisions/m0-d23-assurance-vocabulary.md)
assigns the assurance records and readiness rules below:

| Concern | Conflict | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gap, finding, deviation, and coverage gap | Separate context-owned records link through source and remediation references | M0-D23 |
| "Exception" | An approved `Waiver` differs from an auditor-found `AuditTestException` | M0-D23 |
| Risk acceptance | R1-07 owns the decision; R2-07 links to it | M0-D23 |
| Review and approval | EN-04 shares an immutable decision shape; each workflow owns decisions and transitions | M0-D23, EN-04 |
| Readiness rules | R1-08 owns rules; later snapshots and views bind exact rule and result versions | M0-D23 |
| Accessibility and browser support | Decided: WCAG 2.2 AA; current and previous major desktop Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari | [M0-D24](../product/decisions/m0-d24-accessibility-and-browsers.md) |
| Firm-owned material inside a client tenant | Advisory working notes live in the client's advisory compartment; audit workpapers, testing documentation, and report drafts remain in attest software. Own-attest closure/offboarding requires a record package and attributed delivery there; hold remains until delivery. Offboarding retention duration remains open. | [M0-D25](../product/decisions/m0-d25-client-tenancy.md), [M0-D27](../product/decisions/m0-d27-attest-scope.md), #346 |
| "Tenant" and "organization" | Decided: tenant is the technical name of a client organization; `tenant_id` in contracts, organization in product text | [M0-D25](../product/decisions/m0-d25-client-tenancy.md) |
| "Engagement" | `ServiceEngagement` (F1-07) differs from the client's `AuditEngagement` | M0-D23, F1-07 |

When a later decision changes ownership, update this document, the affected
stories, and the issue.

## Tenancy and firm services

A person or firm may create and manage many organizations for itself or its
clients, and delegate most organization management to client personnel. Each client
`Organization` is a tenant: the security, isolation, and ownership boundary for
that client's program, people, inventories, evidence, decisions, and history.
The hosted subscription and add-ons belong to that organization. Self-hosting
is free. There is no separate firm tenant or subscription boundary; revisit a
firm entity if actual firm-level records or obligations require one, rather
than because one account manages multiple organizations (M0-D25).

Platform-level content exists outside every tenant and is referenced by exact
version: criteria catalog editions, firm templates (F1-04), and the firm-staff
directory. A tenant may copy from platform-level content with provenance, but
client data never flows back into it except through an explicit, reviewed,
de-identified contribution.

A `PlatformUser` is a person who can sign in. One `FederatedIdentity` (issuer
plus subject) binds to one platform user, who may hold a `Membership` in
several organizations. Each membership has an affiliation of client personnel,
firm staff, or guest (an external consultant engaged directly by the client).
A firm staff member's practice eligibility is recorded in the platform-level
firm-staff directory (`FirmStaffMember`), and each `ServiceEngagement` carries
its practice; an `EngagementAssignment` takes its effective Advisor or Attest
role from its engagement (M0-D25, M0-D26).

Any signed-in platform user with a verified email may create an organization
and becomes its first Org Admin. They may create more than one organization,
invite client personnel, and explicitly delegate organization administration.
Client or provider billing administration is separately authorized for that
organization; creation and delegation preserve its identity and history. The
requirements and remaining policy decisions are in
[business operations](../product/business-operations.md). Only platform operators suspend, reactivate,
or offboard an organization. A platform operator sees tenant metadata only
(lifecycle, administrator roster, usage) and reads business records only
through a membership or engagement assignment of their own. An existing
operator grants or revokes operator status in the product, with an audit log.
Deployment configuration seeds only the first operator, and the last operator
cannot be revoked.

Every organization-scoped request, job, message, projection, and notification
resolves exactly one active organization. The accepted M0-A07 routing in
[ADR 0009](../architecture/decisions/0009-tenant-identity-federation-and-context.md) is:

- after sign-in, a user is sent to their only organization, chooses among
  several, or sees a no-access or pending-invitation page; every verified
  signed-in user may also create an organization (self-service, M0-D25);
- browser routes identify the organization by a unique, URL-friendly slug;
- organization-scoped APIs identify it by an opaque, immutable `tenant_id` path
  parameter, and the server verifies membership for that `tenant_id` on every
  request.

A slug is an attribute, not an identity. It follows the rules in R1-15: 4 to 63
lowercase letters, digits, and single inner hyphens, starting with a letter; no
collision with the reserved-route registry of top-level server and client
routes; never the `tenant_id` format; unique across current and retired slugs,
with retired slugs never reassigned. An unknown slug and a slug the user cannot
access produce the same not-found result.

The firm provides advisory and attest services. A `ServiceEngagement` records a
service the firm provides to one client organization, its type, scope, period,
team, and acceptance decision (F1-07). It is distinct from the client's Type I
or Type II audit engagement, whose auditor may be an external firm. Professional
Advisor and Attest access is granted only through an `EngagementAssignment` to
an accepted engagement; ending the assignment revokes that practice access.
Core organization administration uses explicitly granted client roles and does
not require or create a professional engagement. Neither firm affiliation nor
organization creation grants practice access, and client-role grants do not
bypass the independence rules (M0-D03, M0-D25, M0-D26). A platform
operator's `PlatformOperatorGrant` covers tenant lifecycle, administrator
roster, and usage metadata only, never business records.

Independence walls (F1-08) are enforced platform behavior:

- `NonattestServiceRecord` records advisory services performed for a client and
  whether they involved management functions;
- a versioned `IndependenceRuleSet` and an `IndependenceEvaluation` govern
  whether an attest engagement or staff assignment may be accepted;
- advisory and attest compartments inside a client organization limit which
  team can see which material;
- attest staff never author or approve the client's management records.

The rules themselves require professional validation (M0-D26). M0-D27 defines
collaboration and handoff here; the firm's own audit workpapers, testing
documentation, and report drafts remain in attest software. Own-attest closure
or offboarding requires a record package and attributed delivery into that
software, and retains the engagement hold until delivery is recorded.

## Identity has three planes

Compliance must keep these planes separate even when they describe the same
human being.

```text
External identity provider       Compliance platform        Access-governance data
OIDC issuer and subject    ->     Membership and assignments  Person, ServiceIdentity, or Account
IdP group or claim         ->     Team or role mapping        Group, role, or entitlement
Authenticates the caller          Governs Compliance          Describes access under review
```

### Authentication identity

A `FederatedIdentity` is a binding between a provider identity and a
`PlatformUser`, who may hold memberships in several organizations.

- Its stable provider key is issuer plus subject.
- Email, display name, and claim values are descriptive and may change.
- A user may acquire a replacement or additional provider identity without
  losing platform authorship or assignments.
- Authentication proves who is calling. It does not, by itself, grant access to
  an organization or program.

### Platform membership and authorization

An `Organization` is the tenant: the security, isolation, and ownership
boundary for one client. A `Program` belongs to exactly one organization. The
model must not merge organization membership with a single program, and nothing
from one organization is visible to another.

A `Membership` is an organization-local affiliation of a `PlatformUser`, with an
affiliation of client personnel, firm staff, or guest. Its lifecycle is pending, active, suspended, or deprovisioned.
Deprovisioning blocks new access immediately while preserving authorship,
decisions, comments, and historical assignments.

A `Team` is a platform-owned group of members used for access and assignment.
It is not an Auth0 or Entra group and is not a group being reviewed in an
external access campaign.

An `AccessRole` is a stable bundle of platform permissions. The first release
uses a small built-in catalog rather than user-defined permissions
([M0-D03](../product/decisions/m0-d03-roles-and-separation-of-duties.md)):

- Org Admin;
- Compliance Lead;
- Contributor;
- Viewer;
- Advisor (firm staff, through engagement assignment only);
- Attest (firm staff, through engagement assignment only).

Reviewer, management approver, and control owner are responsibilities, not
roles. The first release uses one workspace per organization.

Review, approval, and ownership duties are responsibilities, not additional
roles.

A `RoleAssignment` gives a platform user, membership, or team an access role
within an organization, program, engagement, or deliberately shared resource.
An assignment records its source, effective interval, grantor, and revocation.

Identity-provider group mapping is not in the first release; teams are managed
in the product. A later mapping of an IdP group or claim to a platform team or
role assignment (F1, with per-client identity providers) is explicit,
source-aware, and reviewable. Provider claim values must not become implicit
platform primary keys.

### Responsibility and separation of duties

A `Responsibility` assigns accountable work such as control owner, evidence
contributor, assigned reviewer, access reviewer, corrective-action owner, or
policy approver. It records scope and effective interval.

Access roles answer what a member may do. Responsibilities answer what the
member is expected to do. Authorization evaluates both where appropriate:

```text
active membership
  + scoped role assignment
  + relevant responsibility
  + resource state
  + separation-of-duties policy
  = allowed or denied action
```

A responsibility may be held by a workforce `Person` who never signs in. A
signed-in member then records that person's work on their behalf, and both are
attributed. Self-review and self-approval are denied unless an Org Admin has
recorded a time-bound, reason-required SoD `Waiver` approved by an Org Admin
other than its beneficiary, and waived actions are
flagged in readiness and audit exports (M0-D03).

Changing a team, grant, or responsibility must identify open work that becomes
unassigned. It never changes the recorded performer, reviewer, or approver of
historical work.

### Actors

An `ActorReference` attributes a consequential action to an active member or a
named system process. A team can receive access or responsibility but cannot be
the actor that performed or approved an action.

Attribution retains the stable member or system identity and the relevant
display snapshot. Removing access, renaming a person, or replacing an identity
provider cannot make historical activity anonymous or falsely attribute it to
someone else.

Imported advisor or auditor authorship that did not occur through an
authenticated platform session is represented through source provenance and an
external-author reference. It is not fabricated as platform activity.

## Workforce assurance

A `Person` is an organization-level subject whose employment or engagement
facts help the team evaluate controls and access. It is not a Compliance
`Membership`, a `FederatedIdentity`, or a provider `Account`.

A `Person` keeps a stable platform identity, descriptive attributes, and
source-scoped alternate identifiers. Its `WorkRelationship` records worker
type (employee, contractor, or external collaborator with an internal sponsor),
lifecycle status, manager, organization attributes needed for review, relevant
start/end dates, and observation history. An HRIS source is authoritative, the
identity-provider directory corroborates, and the product's manual workflow
remains usable when neither source is connected. A manually maintained roster
is authoritative when no HRIS exists ([M0-D06](../product/decisions/m0-d06-workforce-source.md)). Personal contact details,
employment status reason, and the manager chain are restricted fields,
authorized separately. Conflicting sources remain visible until an attributable
reconciliation decision identifies the accepted value and rationale.

A `WorkforceSnapshot` freezes the people universe used for a policy campaign,
training population, access review, control evaluation, or audit population.
Joiner, mover, and leaver facts may trigger compliance work, but imported facts
do not silently grant platform access, revoke provider access, or decide a
review outcome.

An NHI is a `ServiceIdentity`, not a person. Its accountable human or team
owner, approved purpose, environment, lifecycle, and review date are governed
relationships. An NHI has one accountable person or team owner and a review
date at most one year out. Provider observations can propose an NHI or owner correlation;
an authorized user accepts or rejects it.

## Application inventory

An `Application` is software the organization believes it uses or depends on.
It records business purpose, owner, vendor or internal ownership, lifecycle,
criticality, data sensitivity, authentication method, known user population,
and whether and why access review applies. Discovery source and confidence are
preserved so that declared, imported, discovered, duplicate, unknown, and
retired applications can be reconciled rather than silently merged. The manual
inventory slice may record a tenant-declared classification; that statement is
attributed but remains `classification_unverified` until the classification
vocabulary and authority decisions are approved. An absent classification stays
an explicit `classification_unresolved` gap.

A `SystemInstance` is a concrete tenant, organization, account, environment, or
other access boundary for an application. One application may have multiple
system instances, and one instance must not be reused for unrelated
applications merely because the provider is the same.

The inventory links applications and system instances to the program boundary,
vendors or subservice organizations, data and process scope, controls, evidence
sources, system owners, access owners, review cadence, and explicit inclusion or
exclusion decisions. An application cannot silently disappear from review scope
because an import or integration stops returning it.

## Technology and information inventory

A `SystemComponent` is a material technology resource needed to explain or
control the scoped system, such as a cloud account or subscription,
infrastructure environment, network boundary, managed endpoint class,
repository, or data store. A component records stable source identities,
ownership, type, location or environment, criticality, lifecycle, and scope
decision. It may relate to several applications but is not another application.

An `InformationAsset` is a governed information set or data class, not every
individual file or database row. It records purpose, owner, classification,
customer or personal-information relevance, locations, retention expectation,
and applicable commitments or controls. A versioned `DataFlow` describes a
material movement between actors, applications, components, providers, or
locations and identifies protection expectations.

These records are audit-relevant inventory projections. Cloud, MDM, CMDB,
repository, and data-governance systems remain the operational sources. Manual,
imported, and discovered records preserve provenance, matching, rejected rows,
missing-source behavior, and reconciliation decisions.

## Commitments and system requirements

A `ServiceCommitment` records a promise made to customers or users. A
`SystemRequirement` records a contractual, legal, policy, architectural, or
other requirement that governs how the service system should operate. Each has
a stable identity, source reference, owner, applicability, effective interval,
and version history.

A `UserEntityResponsibility` represents a complementary user-entity control
(CUEC) expected of customers or other user entities. A
`SubserviceResponsibility` represents a relevant complementary subservice-
organization control (CSOC) or other dependency. These remain distinct from the
organization's controls and from evidence that anyone performed them.

Commitments and requirements may relate to services, scope, criteria, risks,
applications, system instances, components, information assets, providers,
controls, and policies. The approved applicable versions supply structured
source material to the system description and engagement snapshots.

## Risk and provider oversight

A `Risk` describes a scoped uncertainty and its potential effect. A versioned
`RiskAssessment` records context, likelihood and impact rationale, inherent
risk, existing controls, chosen response, target or residual risk, owner,
reviewer, and review date. The scoring method is explicit and versioned; labels
or numbers from different methods are not silently compared.

A `RiskTreatment` is an accountable avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept
decision. Acceptance is time-bounded and authorized. Treatment work links to
controls, policies, provider decisions, or corrective actions and is verified
before the risk is represented as addressed.

A `Provider` records a vendor or subservice organization and its material
services, systems and data access, owner, criticality, contract and review
dates, and boundary treatment. A `ProviderAssessment` binds due diligence,
assurance artifacts such as SOC reports or bridge letters, coverage periods,
exceptions, compensating controls, reviewer conclusions, and remediation to the
exact provider and service relationship reviewed. Procurement remains the
source of commercial transactions.

## External systems and access governance

A `SystemInstance` records the source identity and access boundary whose
principals and entitlements are examined. Its application, owner, sensitivity,
and lifecycle come from the application inventory. Review inclusion and cadence
belong to the access campaign or governed review-scope relationship.

`Person` is the governed human identity and `ServiceIdentity` is the governed
non-human identity (NHI) whose access may span several system instances. The
workforce roster owns accepted human lifecycle and manager facts and the first
service-identity/owner relationship. An NHI may represent a workload, service,
integration, automation, or bot and must have an accountable human or team
owner, approved purpose, environment, lifecycle, and authentication or
credential model. Neither record is a platform member or receives Compliance
access merely because an observed account is correlated with it.

Observed provider objects are `Account`, `Group`, `Role`, and `Entitlement`
records, connected by `GroupMember`, `RoleEntitlement`, and `AccessAssignment`
relationships. A provider service principal or workload identity is an
`Account`-like source object correlated to a governed `ServiceIdentity`. An
account may correlate to a `Person` or a `ServiceIdentity`; a group or role is
an access structure and does not become a human or NHI merely because members
or assumers use it. Each canonical record has a platform-generated immutable
ID. Its external identity is source-scoped by system instance, object type,
and immutable provider identifier; email and display name are attributes,
and matching an external identifier does not by itself prove correlation.

Human-versus-NHI classification is explicit, attributable, and reviewable.
Provider hints can propose a classification but cannot silently decide it.
Ambiguous, shared, generic, dormant, ownerless, and mixed-use principals remain
visible. A change of classification preserves the prior decision and identifies
affected expectations, campaigns, and findings.

An `Entitlement` describes access available within a system instance, including
a role, group membership, license, permission set, repository role, or similar
grantable access. External groups and roles retain their source identifiers and
relationships. Direct, group-derived, nested-group, and other inherited grant
paths remain distinguishable.

An `AccessAssignment` is the observed direct grant, and `EffectiveAccess` is
the reviewable derived relationship:

```text
account or service identity + entitlement + resource + system instance + grant path
```

An access review population contains frozen snapshots of persons, service
identities, accounts, group and role relationships, effective access, and grant
paths—not live platform memberships. A membership and a person, service
identity, or account may be explicitly correlated, but none owns or replaces
the others.

An `AccessExpectation` is an approved, time-bounded assertion about access that
should or should not exist. It identifies the applicable subject or governed
population, system instance, entitlement or access profile, rationale, source,
approver, effective interval, and any exception. Expectations can highlight
expected, unexpected, missing, expired, privileged, or unresolved access, but
they never pre-decide a review item. A human reviewer remains accountable for
the campaign decision.

Human access expectations may rely on employment or engagement status,
manager, job function, and approved business need. NHI expectations may rely on
workload purpose, accountable owner, environment, permitted authentication or
credential mechanism, least-privilege entitlements, and expiry or review date.
An application may prohibit an entire provider principal kind—for example, no
AWS IAM user principals—while permitting federated roles used by separately
classified human and NHI subjects.

A `PopulationSnapshot` records the source, capture time, manual capture or
optional import/collection provenance, included and rejected items,
normalization decisions, and content identity. Manually recording observed
accounts and relationships does not require a connector; the same source,
identity, and completeness rules apply. Launching an `AccessReviewCampaign` freezes its population,
instructions, reviewers, due date, and applicable rules.

Each `AccessReviewItem` receives an attributable keep, modify, revoke, or
unable-to-determine `AccessDecision`. Required change produces a
`RemediationAction`; completion requires separate `Verification` or an approved
exception. Provider-side change and platform-side verification remain distinct
facts.

## Primitive categories

| Category | Purpose | Initial examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | States what should exist or happen | Criterion, Control, Policy, SystemInstance, Entitlement |
| Version | Preserves approved content over time | BoundaryVersion, ControlVersion, PolicyVersion, CatalogEdition |
| Relationship | Makes a supported assertion between records | ControlCriterionMapping, EvidenceSupport, ScopeInclusion |
| Responsibility | Assigns accountable work | ControlOwner, AssignedReviewer, RemediationOwner |
| Activity or occurrence | Records work that happened or is expected | ControlOccurrence, PolicyReview, AccessReviewCampaign |
| Artifact | Carries content or a reference to content | EvidenceArtifact, PolicyDocument, ImportFile, AuditPackage |
| Request | Asks for bounded work or support | EvidenceRequest, AdvisorRequest, AuditorRequest |
| Decision | Records an authorized outcome and rationale | ReviewDecision, AccessDecision, RiskAcceptance, ReadinessDecision |
| Waiver and remediation | Carries an authorized time-bounded deviation from an expectation or known deficiency to resolution | Waiver, Finding, CorrectiveAction, Verification |
| Snapshot | Freezes applicable state for later reliance | PopulationSnapshot, TypeIBaseline, TypeIIPeriodClose |
| Provenance | Explains where data came from | SourceReference, ImportBatch, CollectionRun, content identity |
| Attribution | Explains who or what acted and when | ActorReference, external author, occurred time, effective time |

Application, Person, ServiceIdentity, Account, Group, GroupMember,
AccessAssignment, EffectiveAccess, grant path, and AccessExpectation use these same
categories; they are not an isolated access-review data model.

The exact state machine belongs to the workflow that owns the record. Do not
create a universal `Entity`, `Activity`, `Task`, `Status`, or `Review` aggregate
whose generic states erase these distinctions.

An `AccountableWorkItem` is a read model over work owned by those explicit
workflows. It provides a consistent assignee, team, due date, urgency, blocked
reason, and destination for navigation, notification, and escalation. Completing
or reassigning work invokes the source workflow; it cannot independently claim
that a control, review, request, or remediation is complete.

## Shared platform primitives

Some mechanisms are shared by every bounded context. They are delivered once,
as approved enablers in [backlog.md](../product/backlog.md), and consuming stories must
not build feature-local substitutes. Each is grounded in an architecture
decision recorded in M0.

| Primitive | Enabler | Architecture decision | Model rules it enforces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization, tenant isolation, and `ActorReference` | EN-01 | M0-A04, M0-A07 | Server-enforced authorization; exactly one resolved organization per request, job, and message; attribution to members or named system processes; restricted and other-tenant records absent from lists and counts |
| Versions, effective intervals, and impact preview | EN-02 | M0-A01 | Drafts, immutable approved versions, successor proposals, effective history, and never-used-draft deletion |
| Snapshots, content identity, and amendments | EN-03 | M0-A01, M0-A02 | Frozen snapshots unaffected by later changes; amendments linked to their originals |
| Attributable decisions and separation of duties | EN-04 | — | A decision binds the exact input version, actor, time, and rationale. Each workflow keeps its own state machine; this is not a universal `Review` aggregate |
| Optional import batches, reconciliation, and replay | EN-05 | M0-A06 | Preview, explicit whole-batch acceptance, inspectable staging failures, all-or-nothing domain effects, provenance, tombstones, and safe replay |
| Artifact storage and content identity | EN-06 | M0-A03 | Immutable content identity, quarantine, derived artifacts, and per-artifact access |

Read models such as readiness and accountable work follow M0-A05: they are
projections that reconcile to source records and show their as-of time.

## Core record relationships

### Program and engagement

- An organization owns memberships, teams, role assignments, and programs.
- A program carries the continuing control environment through readiness,
  Type I, Type II, and later periods.
- An engagement or period references stable versions and snapshots from the
  program; it does not clone mutable records without provenance.
- A stage transition is an attributable decision against a stable readiness or
  outcome snapshot.
- A `SystemDescription` is a management-authored, versioned description of the
  scoped service system. It uses approved boundary, inventory, commitment,
  provider, control, and change records but is not a generated replacement for
  management narrative or the control catalog.
- Type I binds an approved description to the point-in-time baseline. Type II
  carries a successor through the observation period, identifies significant
  changes, and binds its approved version to the period close and management
  assertion.
- Management assertions, representation letters, service-auditor tests and
  results, and the issued report retain separate authorship and provenance. The
  product never derives an auditor opinion from readiness status.

### Controls and operation

- A `Control` is the organization's defined response to one or more risks or
  criteria: what must happen, why, where, by whom, how often, and what evidence
  is expected. It has stable identity and one or more versions.
- Creating a control creates a draft. Activating it requires review of the exact
  version plus its applicability, mappings, responsibility, cadence, and
  expected evidence.
- An active or historically used control is never edited in place. A change
  creates a proposed successor version with an effective date and an impact
  preview covering mappings, responsibilities, future occurrences, evidence
  expectations, readiness, and open or frozen engagements.
- Only a never-used draft with no retained business relationships may be
  deleted. Every other removal is retirement or supersession. Retirement stops
  future applicability and work without deleting prior versions, occurrences,
  evidence, decisions, or snapshots.
- A mapping relates a specific control version to a criterion edition and
  records rationale and review state.
- Responsibilities and cadence apply for an effective interval.
- A control occurrence represents one expected or actual performance for a
  point in time or covered period.
- An attestation records the performer, result, time, and submitted support.
- An independent review records a decision against the exact submission.
- Failed, skipped, rejected, or missing work creates an explainable gap or
  exception path; it does not disappear from readiness calculations.

### Policies

- A `Policy` is a governed statement of organizational intent, responsibility,
  or required behavior. It has stable identity, owner, purpose, audience,
  review cadence, lifecycle, and one or more immutable approved versions.
- A policy version may contain authored content or identify an immutable source
  artifact. It records its effective interval and exact approval decision.
- `PolicyApplicability` relationships associate an exact policy version with
  applications or system instances, controls, criteria, risks, vendors,
  processes, and organizational scope where useful for navigation and impact
  analysis. Direct policy-to-criterion association never counts as control
  coverage, and a policy never proves that a control operated.
- Editing a draft does not alter an approved version. Updating an approved
  policy creates a proposed successor that must be reviewed and approved before
  becoming effective. Supersession preserves the version and relationships that
  applied to earlier engagements.
- Only a never-used draft with no retained business relationships may be
  deleted. An approved or historically used policy is superseded or retired.
  Retirement stops future applicability and review work while preserving audit
  history and packages.
- A `PolicyDistributionCampaign` binds an exact approved policy version to a
  frozen audience and delivery period. Each acknowledgement or exception is
  attributable; a later policy version never rewrites an earlier campaign.
- A `TrainingRequirement` may reference externally delivered course content.
  Compliance owns the applicable population, completion observation, exception,
  evidence, and control relationship, not the learning content or LMS workflow.

### Evidence

- An evidence artifact has stable identity, immutable content identity,
  provenance, sensitivity, capture time, and applicable period.
- An evidence support relationship explains what the artifact supports and why.
- Reusing an artifact creates another support relationship; it does not copy or
  silently reinterpret the artifact.
- Evidence acceptance is a review decision in context. An artifact is not
  universally sufficient merely because another reviewer accepted it elsewhere.
- Evidence access, disclosure, retention, engagement hold, redaction, and
  disposition are explicit decisions. A redacted file is a derived artifact
  linked to its source; it never replaces the original content identity.
- Retention expiry does not delete evidence that remains bound to an active
  engagement hold, delivered package, unresolved request, finding, or legal
  obligation. Authorized disposition preserves metadata and the decision while
  making unavailable content unmistakable.

### Findings and decisions

- A finding retains its source wording separately from internal analysis.
- Corrective actions are explicit, owned work linked to affected records.
- Risk acceptance is a time-bounded authorized decision, not a closed finding.
- Closure requires resolution evidence and review. Reopening preserves the
  earlier closure decision.

### Audit populations and samples

- An `AuditPopulationDefinition` states the source universe, covered period,
  inclusion and exclusion rules, expected completeness evidence, and fields
  authorized for audit use.
- An immutable `AuditPopulation` binds that definition to a close snapshot or
  other stable source snapshots and records reconciliation totals, generation
  time, provenance, and amendments.
- Population rows may reference control occurrences or externally sourced
  hires, terminations, access changes, production changes, incidents,
  vulnerabilities, vendors, tickets, or other events. Compliance does not need
  to own the operational workflow that created them.
- An authorized user can capture those facts manually and attach source
  support. Native `SignificantChange` and `ComplianceIncident` records identify the recorder and event
  times without requiring an external tool or inventing external IDs. An
  `IncidentReference` remains a reference to a real source incident; it is
  distinct from the native operating-period incident workflow.
- Each row has a stable identity and an explicit included, excluded, duplicate,
  missing, or unresolved classification. A missing or partial source never
  appears complete.
- A `SampleSelection` records who selected exact frozen population rows and
  when. Supplemental evidence and auditor conclusions do not modify either the
  row or the population used for selection.

## History, snapshots, and time

Every consequential record distinguishes as needed:

- when the action occurred;
- when it became effective;
- which period it covers;
- when the platform observed or imported it;
- which actor or external source supplied it;
- which revision or snapshot a later decision relied on.

A current-state audit log alone is insufficient. Business history lives in
explicit versions, submissions, decisions, effective intervals, amendments,
and snapshots. An activity feed is a derived navigation aid.

A snapshot contains stable references plus enough immutable identity to prove
what was relied on. Later source changes do not alter it. Authorized correction
after a freeze is an amendment linked to the original snapshot and identifies
its downstream impact.

## Cross-story integration rules

- Platform authorization is enforced by the server for every command and query;
  client route guards are only a navigation aid.
- Every organization-scoped command, query, artifact, job, message, projection,
  search, export, and notification is scoped to one organization, and automated
  cross-tenant leak tests prove it.
- Every responsibility has a valid governed assignee, including a `Person`
  who does not sign in. In-product action and notification recipients resolve
  to active authorized memberships or teams; on-behalf-of recording retains
  both recorder and responsible person. Membership changes expose orphaned work.
- Every access campaign starts from the governed application inventory and
  accounts for every in-scope system instance. Missing or failed source data is
  unknown, never evidence of zero accounts or zero access.
- Every observed access relationship remains distinct from the approved
  expectation and human review decision applied to it.
- Every status and count drills into the records and calculation time behind it.
- Optional import and collection paths have explicit provenance, failure
  reporting, and safe replay behavior. Imports preview proposed changes and
  require explicit acceptance; partial staging results remain inspectable,
  while accepted domain effects follow ADR 0005's all-or-nothing contract.
  EN-05 is required by consuming import stories, not by every manual workflow.
- Every feature can reach its primary outcome through manual entry, uploads,
  explicit decisions, and native product workflows without a connected source or
  collection runtime. Turning an optional source off does not disable that
  workflow or change the meaning of its records.
- Every source is identified as authoritative, corroborating, or discovery-only
  for a stated business question. A collected fact proposes or supports governed
  state; it never silently becomes truth outside its approved authority.
- Missing rows, tombstones, pagination gaps, and failed or stale collection are
  explicit reconciliation states. None can silently delete, merge, retire, or
  de-scope a governed record or prove that a population is complete.
- Every access campaign identifies its application and reviewed-system universe,
  the authoritative-subject and access sources received or missing, the expected
  access baseline, and the actual access paths under review.
- Every externally visible handoff has an explicit content selection, preview,
  authorization check, delivery record, and retained manifest.
- Every audit population states its source universe, rules, completeness proof,
  reconciliation, stable row identities, and frozen selection relationship.
- Every output labels management-authored, auditor-authored, imported, and
  product-calculated material and preserves the source rather than inferring an
  auditor conclusion.
- Evidence and sensitive inventory or workforce fields retain artifact- or
  field-appropriate access through indexes, work queues, counts, exports,
  notifications, packages, and historical views.
- Every consequential decision identifies the exact input revision or snapshot,
  actor, time, rationale, and resulting state.
- Every workflow contributes to the same accountable work experience and
  readiness model without surrendering ownership of its domain state.
- Standalone and split API/worker deployments expose the same business
  behavior, authorization, history, and failure semantics.

## Decision records

Every M0 discovery decision this model depends on has been made. The product
decision records are under [`decisions/`](../product/decisions) and the architecture
decision records under

first-client facts are gathered in the linked issues; they do not reopen these
decisions.
